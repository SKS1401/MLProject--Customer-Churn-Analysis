# MLProject--Customer-Churn-Analysis

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn using a Telco customer dataset. The goal is to predict whether a customer will leave the service (churn) based on various features such as tenure, contract type, monthly charges, and more.

A logistic regression model was trained and evaluated, achieving an accuracy of 72.56%.
